# Anubhav Setu - SIH50VEG

This project, **Anubhav Setu**, was developed as part of the **Smart India Hackathon**. The goal was to create a **web-based application** that connects alumni and students across different colleges, fostering meaningful connections and facilitating the sharing of experiences. This project represents my early exploration into backend development.

## About the Project

I aimed to bridge the gap between students and alumni by providing a platform where they can interact and build a strong community. **Anubhav Setu** was designed to serve as a bridge, allowing students to gain insights and advice from experienced alumni.

### Dependencies

This project utilizes several key dependencies for its backend functionality:

- **@google/generative-ai**: Provides integration with Google's Generative AI, allowing dynamic and AI-driven content.
- **axios**: A promise-based HTTP client, used for making requests to APIs.
- **body-parser**: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware, primarily used for parsing JSON and URL-encoded data.
- **codemirror**: A versatile text editor implemented in JavaScript, used to enhance the text-editing experience on the front end.
- **compilex**: A tool that helps in compiling code on the server-side, useful for running code snippets submitted by users.
- **ejs (Embedded JavaScript)**: A templating engine that allows us to generate HTML with embedded JavaScript, making dynamic rendering of web pages simpler.
- **express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **express-fileupload**: Middleware to handle file uploads.
- **express-handlebars**: Another templating engine, which is used to create reusable web components with a layout system.
- **multer**: A middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, primarily used for uploading files.
- **mysql**: MySQL database connector, used for managing and interacting with the relational database.

#### Dev Dependencies

- **nodemon**: A development tool that automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected, improving development workflow.
